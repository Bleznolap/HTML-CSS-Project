        <p>Sparing my time to watch <span style="color: #800080
        ;font-weight: bold;">'Three Idiots'</span> after my final examination (first/second semester) during my first year as an
        undergraduate was an intriguing experience for me. The key actor to me is the man by the name Silencer. The role he played
        in that movie was catching as a student. The man was supposedly brilliant who engages in blind cramming. However, on a said day, 
        he was to deliver a speech on behalf of the school and as usual he engaged is normal blind cramming tool. He crammed and delivered 
        verbatim without intelligent consideration of the statement he's making. The audience were enticed to laugh out loud and he gave 
        more passion to his presentation thinking he is making sense to his listeners. Conclusively, the presentation he gave that day
        revealed is idiotic brilliancy.(Word Count: 134)</p>
        <p>One of my favourite website that I often visit is <span style="color: #5f3d37;font-weight: bold;">LinkedIn</span>. LinkedIn is more than just a social media platform rather a platform
            that helps its users to develop professionally and to heighten their professional network. I have been able to connect with
            people from diverse ethnic, cultural, national, and religious origin which would have been almost impossible without such platform. 
            Most of my connections are people with similar profession who aspire, desire, & acquire growth through scholarships & opportunities.
            Aside, I have been privilege to follow individuals like Prof. Ndubuisi Ekekwe to tap from his wealth of knowledge, experience, 
            and exposure. Additionally, LinkedIn as a learning platform which most times reward me with free learning opportunities to 
            acquire skills relevant to my career aspirations and professional development. I have leverage on some of them to acquire 
            skills ranging from data science and analytics to coaching and leadership. In fact, I have been more street smart, a skill 
            needed to thrive as an entrepreneur, with nuggets, posts, and podcasts posted on LinkedIn. I, therefore, encourage anyone to 
            have a LinkedIn profile to benefit from a whole world of opportunities it offers.(Word Count: 191)
